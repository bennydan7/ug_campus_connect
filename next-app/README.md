This folder contains a Next.js (App Router) migration of the UG Campus Connect frontend.

Commands:
- pnpm install
- pnpm run dev (starts Next.js on port 3001)

Notes:
- API routes /api/ping and /api/demo are implemented as Next.js route handlers.
- This is an initial scaffold; more components/pages from the original client/ can be migrated as needed.
